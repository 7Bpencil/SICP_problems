With (square x) we should evaluate x only once
With (* x x) we should evaluate both arguments

Originally in our case x is evaluated by procedure with R(n)=Θ(log(n))
(expmod method is very similar to fast-exp procedure)

But after Hugo's changes procedure becomes tree recursion.

And we can find that if we double the size of the problem (6->12 for example)
number of vertices (and operations) of the process' tree will be doubled too.

So new procedure has R(n)=Θ(n)
